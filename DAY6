 Day 6 â€“ Practicing Python on Google Colab

ðŸ”¹ What I Did Today:
Today, I explored Google Colab to practice Python more efficiently. I used it as an online Jupyter Notebook to run and test my code without installing anything locally.

I focused on:

Variables in Python (declaration, updating values, type checking)

String operations like slicing, concatenation, formatting, and built-in methods (lower(), upper(), replace(), split(), etc.)

ðŸ§  Key Concepts Covered:
- How Google Colab works

- Writing and executing Python code in notebook cells

- String manipulation techniques

âœ… Outcome:
Now I'm more comfortable using Google Colab for Python practice, and I understood how to work with strings and variables effectively in Python.
