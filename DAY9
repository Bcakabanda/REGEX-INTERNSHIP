Day 9 â€“ Tuples & Pattern Problems in Python
ðŸ”¹ What I Did Today:
Today, I revised tuples and explored some pattern-based problems in Python using Google Colab.

I practiced:

Tuple creation and nesting

Accessing tuple elements and using them in loops

Solving basic pattern problems using for loops

Right-angled triangle pattern

Number and star (*) patterns

ðŸ§  Key Concepts Covered:
Loop control for patterns

Combining tuples with loops

Logic building through pattern exercises

âœ… Outcome:
Got a better grip on tuples and improved my loop logic by solving pattern problems. It helped sharpen my Python fundamentals.
