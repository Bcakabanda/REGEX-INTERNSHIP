Day 10 â€“ Deep Dive into Python Functions
ðŸ”¹ What I Did Today:
Today, I focused on learning functions in Python in depth. I understood how to define, call, and use functions effectively.

I covered:

Creating functions with def

Function parameters and return values

Scope of variables (local vs global)

Writing reusable code using functions

Building logic inside functions to solve problems

ðŸ§  Key Concepts Covered:
Function definition and invocation

Parameter passing techniques

Using functions to organize and simplify code

âœ… Outcome:
Now I can confidently write and use functions to break down complex problems into smaller parts, making my code cleaner and more efficient.
