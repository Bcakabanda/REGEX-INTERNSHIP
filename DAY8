List methods like append(), remove(), sort(), reverse()

Tuple properties (immutable nature)

Conversion between lists and tuples

ðŸ§  Key Concepts Covered:
Difference between list and tuple

When to use list vs tuple

How to loop through lists/tuples

âœ… Outcome:
Now I understand how to store and work with multiple values using lists and tuples. Feeling more confident with Python data structures.
