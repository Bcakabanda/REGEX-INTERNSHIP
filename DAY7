Day 7 â€“ Loops & Conditional Statements in Python
ðŸ”¹ What I Did Today:
Today, I continued practicing Python on Google Colab and learned about loops and conditional statements.

I explored:

if, elif, and else conditions

Comparison and logical operators

Looping with for and while

Using break, continue, and pass in loops

ðŸ§  Key Concepts Covered:
Writing condition-based logic

Looping through lists and ranges

Nesting loops and conditions

âœ… Outcome:
Understood how to control the flow of a Python program using conditions and loops. I also wrote a few mini programs to test my logic and practice.
