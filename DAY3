INTRODUCING  ABOUT AWS ( HOW TO HOST WEBSITE'S ON AWS )

Today, I explored how to host a website using AWS EC2. I launched a new EC2 instance (Ubuntu, free tier), connected to it using SSH, and set up an Apache web server.

After setting everything up, I uploaded my website files and replaced the default Apache page. Once done, I tested the public IP in the browser â€” and it worked! My site was live on the internet.

Tools I Used:

AWS EC2 (Ubuntu)
Apache Web Server
SSH via terminal
