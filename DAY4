Day 4 â€“ Learning Git & GitHub

ðŸ”¹ What I Did Today:

Today, I focused on learning the basics of Git and GitHub. I understood how version control works and practiced all the important Git commands.

I learned how to:

Push code from my local machine to GitHub.

Clone a repository from GitHub to my local system.

Track changes using git status, git add, git commit, and git push.

Work with remote repositories using git clone, git pull, and git remote.

This helped me understand how developers collaborate using Git and how to manage project code efficiently.

ðŸ”§ Commands I Practiced:
git init

git add .

git commit -m "message"

git remote add origin <repo-url>

git push -u origin main

git clone <repo-url>

git pull

âœ… Outcome:
Now Iâ€™m comfortable with pushing and pulling code using Git. Iâ€™ve set up my GitHub account, pushed a test project, and also cloned a repo to my system successfully.
