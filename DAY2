Day 2 Reflection:

On the second day, I learned more Git Bash commands like mv (to move files) and cp (to copy files). We were also introduced to GitHub and how it is used in companies. I learned how to push code from local to GitHub and pull or clone code from GitHub to my local machine. These concepts helped me understand how teams share and manage code easily.git
